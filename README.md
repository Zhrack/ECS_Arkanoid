# ECS_Arkanoid
An Arkanoid clone I'm developing from scratch in C++11 with SFML. It has a Entity-Component-System architecture, messaging system between components and more.

This project has been deprecated. I noticed that some unhappy choices on the base architecture of the ECS made for an worse implementation.
Now restarting with a more conventional ECS architecture on https://github.com/Zhrack/ECS_Architecture
